# Amazon Music Playlist Scraper

## Quick Reference: Agentic Change Rules
**All agents and developers MUST follow these rules for every change. The system will automatically log, validate, and update context and documentation.**

- Plan all changes with explicit, priority-tagged TODOs (PRIORITY: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
- Validate and update Javadocs and comments after every change.
- **Log progress in the README after every action, including code changes, refactors, and documentation updates.**
- **After any code edit action (including minor changes), immediately log the change in the README under the Agentic Change Iteration Summary. No code edit is complete until this log is updated.**
- **Validate and update all related documentation and comments after each change.**
- **After every code change, review all affected files for outdated documentation and comments.**
- **Compare the current implementation against the README log summary and outstanding TODOs.**
- **Compare the README log summary and outstanding TODOs against the current implementation.**
- **Update Javadocs, inline comments, and README sections to accurately reflect the latest code and workflow.**
- **Log the validation and any documentation updates in the README under the Agentic Change Iteration Summary.**
- **If any discrepancies or outdated documentation are found, resolve them immediately and log the fix.**
- Update README, inline comments, and TODOs whenever code changes affect workflow, extensibility, or logging.
- Log all major actions, decisions, and error cases in code and documentation.
- Never skip these stepsâ€”context and documentation must always be up to date.

## Overview
This project scrapes playlists and songs from Amazon Music, validates and enriches metadata, and exports results to CSV and PostgreSQL. The workflow is robust, modular, and extensible for future metadata sources and validation logic. All major classes, interfaces, and utility methods are documented with Javadocs describing their responsibilities, extensibility points, and error handling.

## Workflow
1. **Extraction**: Metadata for each song is extracted from the Amazon Music site using multiple selectors per field, managed by a central registry (`MetadataField`).
2. **Cross-Checking & Normalization**: The `MetadataCrossChecker` utility normalizes and cross-checks values from all selectors, prioritizing reliable sources and assigning a confidence score. Provenance for each field is tracked in `sourceDetails` (Map<String, Object>), and per-field validation status is tracked in `fieldValidationStatus` (Map<String, Boolean>).
3. **Validation & Enrichment**: After extraction, external validation (e.g., via `MusicBrainzClient`) is performed to further validate and enrich metadata. This adjusts confidence scores and sets the `validated` flag in Song objects. Provenance and per-field validation status are updated accordingly.
4. **Authentication**: Robust authentication detection combines DOM-based checks (profile/account elements, sign-in button) with session cookie validation. Manual login workflow is consolidated and supports callback/event extensibility for automation and error handling.
5. **Export/Import**: All Song fields, including provenance and validation status, are exported to CSV and imported into PostgreSQL. The schema and export logic are registry-driven for future extensibility.
6. **Logging & Error Handling**: All major actions, decisions, and error cases are logged for agentic traceability. Utility methods (e.g., in `Utils`) support robust retries and filename sanitization.

## Key Classes & Fields
- **Song**: Immutable record with all metadata fields, plus `trackAsin`, `validated`, `confidenceScore`, `sourceDetails` (provenance), and `fieldValidationStatus` (per-field validation).
- **Playlist**: Immutable record containing playlist metadata and a list of Song objects.
- **MetadataField**: Represents a metadata field and its selectors. Central registry used for extensibility in extraction, export, and validation.
- **MetadataCrossChecker**: Utility for selector-based cross-checking, normalization, confidence scoring, and provenance validation.
- **MusicBrainzClient**: Utility for validating/enriching metadata via the MusicBrainz API. Updates provenance and per-field validation status.
- **CsvService & PostgresService**: Export/import all Song fields, including provenance and validation status, using registry-driven field lists for extensibility.
- **AuthService**: Handles browser context management, session persistence, automated and manual sign-in workflows, robust authentication detection, and callback/event extensibility for manual login.
- **Utils**: Utility class for robust retries, filename sanitization, and common helper methods.
- **All service interfaces**: Documented with method responsibilities and extensibility points.

## Extensibility
- Registry-driven field management: Add new metadata fields by updating the central registry (`MetadataField` list) and all consumers (CSV, DB, validation) for consistency.
- Per-field validation status and provenance structure are extensible for granular tracking and future sources.
- Manual login workflow supports callback/event extensibility for automation and error handling.
- Utility methods and error handling are documented for maintainability.

- The architecture is modular and supports dependency injection for testing and extension.
- See class-level Javadocs for details on each component's responsibilities and extensibility points.
- All TODOs are tagged by priority and updated as work progresses. Resolved TODOs are marked and removed as appropriate.

## Agentic Change Iteration Summary

### 2025-09-04
- Implemented central registry/config for selectors and field lists via MetadataFieldRegistry.java.
- Refactored ScraperService, CsvService, and (next) PostgresService to use MetadataFieldRegistry for all metadata field lists and selectors, eliminating hardcoded lists.
- Updated documentation and comments in affected files to reflect registry-driven approach.
- Validated changes for errors and consistency; all major workflow TODOs for registry/config are now resolved.
- **[2025-09-04] Fixed: All Song class instantiations now provide all required fields, including provenance and validation status. MusicBrainzClient.java was updated to match the Song record definition.**
- **[2025-09-04] Progress Log:**
    - Refactored ScraperService to use MetadataField registry for all metadata extraction, provenance, and validation logic. Hardcoded selector arrays removed; processSongCandidate and related methods now use MetadataField for extensibility.
- **[2025-09-04] Log: Refactored CsvService and PostgresService to use central MetadataField registries (CSV_FIELDS and DB_FIELDS) for header/schema generation and field mapping. This enables future extensibility and ensures all consumers use a single source of truth for exported/imported fields.**
- **[2025-09-04] Log: Added provenance validation method to MetadataCrossChecker. This method checks that all sourceDetails entries are non-null maps and logs inconsistencies, supporting future extensibility and robust provenance tracking.**
- **[2025-09-04] Log: Added provenance validation call in ScraperService.processSongCandidate after MusicBrainz enrichment. This fulfills the outstanding TODO for validating provenance structure after enrichment/validation. All provenance entries are now checked for non-null map structure, and discrepancies are logged for traceability and future extensibility.**
- **[2025-09-04] Outstanding TODOs and next iteration plan:**
    - [MEDIUM] Refactor MetadataCrossChecker to accept MetadataField for field type inference and normalization. Next: Update CsvService and PostgresService to use MetadataField for headers/schema.
    - [LOW] Validate provenance structure after enrichment/validation for future sources. Next: Add a provenance validation method in ScraperService and MetadataCrossChecker to ensure all sourceDetails values are non-null maps and log inconsistencies.
    - [LOW/MEDIUM] Add more robust handling for interrupted manual login and consolidate manual login prompts. Next: Refactor AuthService to handle browser closure, network errors, and user abort during manual login. Consider merging displayBrowserForManualLogin and waitForUserToContinue into a single workflow, and optionally add a callback/event system.
    - [LOW] Genre and release date enrichment not yet implemented. Next: Add extraction logic for genre and releaseDate in ScraperService and update Song construction accordingly.
    - [MEDIUM] Replace safeWait with Playwright's recommended waits in navigation logic. Next: Refactor ScraperService.goToLibraryPlaylists to use page.waitForSelector and page.waitForLoadState instead of page.waitForTimeout.
- Logging and documentation practices are aligned with agentic change rules.
- The codebase is ready for further iteration or extension.
- All changes, resolutions, and outstanding TODOs are logged here for traceability.
